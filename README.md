# AES-Algorithm-
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm used worldwide to secure data. It encrypts and decrypts data in fixed 128-bit blocks using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits, providing strong confidential protection. AES works through multiple rounds of substitutions, permutations, and mixing of plaintext bytes.
